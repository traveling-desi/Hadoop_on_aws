Calculating user statistics
Write a mapper and reducer that returns - for each user - the number of comments, the average number of upvotes per comment, and the average length of each comment.

Who is most prolific, that is, who has the most comments.

Who is the best liked, the highest average upvotes?

Who is the most verbose, the longest average comment length?
