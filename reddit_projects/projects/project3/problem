Deflategate conversation over time
Way back in 2015, the New England Patriots allegedly deflated footballs used in the AFC championship game. Multiple suspensions, a federal judge got involved, dogs and cats living together. I'm curious how much people were talking about it over the month.

Write a mapper and reducer that counts the number of mentions of "Deflategate" or "Tom Brady" for each day of May 2015 in the NFL subreddit (nfl in the dataset). Also, make sure to count both capitalized and non-capitalized versions.


My results
I found that May 7th had the highest mentions and May 12th had the second highest. For fun (honestly, for fun) I plotted out my results.
