Now, time for you to write a mapper and a reducer, then use your EMR cluster to answer a question. If you need help with this, see our Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce course, specifically Lesson 4.

What is the average number of hits on Saturday? Write a mapper and reducer that calculates the average hits for each day of the week and use EMR to run the job.

By default, EMR will use multiple reducers and you'll get multiple output files, one for each reducer. To tell EMR to use one reducer, add -D mapreduce.job.reduces=1 to the "Arguments" box when creating the step.

You can find the weekday from the "date" field in the following fashion:

from datetime import datetime
weekday = datetime.strptime(date, "%Y-%m-%d").weekday()
then use weekday as the output key.
