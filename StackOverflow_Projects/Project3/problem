Average post lifetime
What is the average lifetime of a post? That is, what's the average time between creation and last activity, in days?

You can find the creation time and last activity time with the fields 'CreationDate' and 'LastActivityDate'. The dates are strings formatted like '2009-07-15T07:17:13.970'. You'll need to use the datetime module to convert these strings into date objects so you can find the time difference. For example:

from datetime import datetime

# Your stuff here

first = parser.get('CreationDate')
first_dt = datetime.strptime(first, '%Y-%m-%dT%X.%f')

# More stuff here



I found that the average post lifetime was 124.54 days.
