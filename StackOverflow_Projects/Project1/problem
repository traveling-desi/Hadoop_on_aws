Post views and scores
Suppose you want to know how view counts correlate with score, but only for posts that have been answered. Write a MapReduce program that makes a new dataset with the view counts and the score only for posts with at least one answer. What's the highest score and how many views did that post have?

This doesn't actually need a reducer since you are just filtering and writing out the results. You can set the number of reducers to zero by including the option -D mapred.reduce.tasks=0. This makes it so no reducers run, and the output from the mapper is the final output.

Your command to run the MapReduce job should look like

$ hadoop jar $HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -D mapred.reduce.tasks=0 -files mapper.py -input Posts.xml -output scores -mapper mapper.py 
The output folder should contain files called something like part-00000. You can concatenate them together, then sort the result with the following command.

$ hdfs dfs -get scores
$ cat scores/part-* | sort -n -k 2 | tail
The first line copies the output folder scores from HDFS to your current directory. The second line first concatenates all the files starting with part-, then sorts the concatenated file. The options -n -k 2 tell sort to use numerical sorting on the second column. And finally, tail displays the last five rows of the sorted output.


The highest score was 1586, with 169360 views.
