Average number of answers
Write a mapper and reducer that calculates the average number of answers for each tag. The output should look like:

tag1 2.23
tag2 1.76
tag3 0.1
...
What's the tag with the highest average number of answers?

Here, either 'mnemonics' or 'procrastination' would be correct, posts tagged with them have 5.5 answers on average.
